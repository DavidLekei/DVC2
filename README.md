# H1 DVC - Digital Vibrance Changer

A small program to automate changing NVidia's Digital Vibrance setting.

# H2 About

This project was created because I like to have my Digital Vibrance set to 100% when playing Counter-Strike Global Offensive. It became annoying to have to open the NVidia Control Panel and manually change the Digital Vibrance using the slider every single time I wanted to play. Thus, DVC was created.

DVC2 is the second version of DVC, as the first version did not work out too well.
